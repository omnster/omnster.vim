omnster.vim
===========

I like the default dark colorscheme for terminal vim is shipped with.
The only exceptions are the colors it uses for folds, colorcolumn,
gutter and probably something else (in other words, almost every cyan or
light grey).

This is the default colorscheme with these high-contrast colors replaced
with darker shades of grey (less than fifty of them).

The colorscheme is built on top of the [template][] by Hans Fugal.
