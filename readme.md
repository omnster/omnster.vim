# omnster.vim

A dark vim colorscheme for terminal, very close to the default one.

I replaced colors for folds, cursorline, gutter (fold column) and completion popup menu to lower contrast. In other words, pretty much all the appearances of cyan and magenta were modified.

The colorscheme is built on top of the [template][] by Hans Fugal.
